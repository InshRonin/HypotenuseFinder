## 📐 Features

- **Visual Representation** of the Pythagorean Theorem with squares on each triangle side.
- **User-Friendly Interface** with input fields for sides `A` and `B`.
- **Real-Time Validation**: If non-numeric or invalid input is entered, the app alerts the user to enter numeric values.
- **Instant Calculation** of the hypotenuse `C` upon submission.
- **Built with C# and Visual Studio** for smooth performance and easy customization.
- **Currently available for Windows only**

## 🛠️ How It Works

The app uses the classic Pythagorean formula:

``c = √(a² + b²)``

-   Enter values for sides `A` and `B`.
-   Click **Submit**.
-   The app calculates and displays the hypotenuse `C`.

If letters or symbols are entered instead of numbers, an alert message will prompt the user to enter valid numeric input.
